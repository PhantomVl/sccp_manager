General Information

Cisco IP Phones support either colored or monochrom background images in various resolutions (depending on model). The background can either be set up in sccp.conf server side or the user can be enabled to select a background image from a defined list of backgrounds. The image has to be a graphic file with .PNG extension. Other requirements apply, depending on phone model (see below).
Set background image server side

Background images can be set up server side in sccp.conf for most modern Cisco IP Phones by using a parameter in the device section. This image is pushed to the phone upon every restart.


[SEPXXXXXXXXX]
...
backgroundImage=http://PATH-TO-BACKGROUND-IMAGE/filename.png

!!!> Phone personalization needs to be set to allow the server to push background or ringtones to the phone in the SEPXXXXXXXXXX.cnf.xml of each phone:

------------------------------------
<phonePersonalization>1</phonePersonalization>
------------------------------------
Enable user to pick a custom background image

When a user is allowed to pick his own background image in the user settings (true in device section of the SEPXXXX.xml config file), the phone searches for the List.xml (case-sensitive) file in the following directories. Depending on the phone model, the required file properties are as follows:
Phone Model 	Image Size 	Thumbnail Size 	Directory
7906 / 7911 	95x34 		23x8 	/Desktops/95x34x1
7941 / 7961 	320x196 	80x49 	/Desktops/320x196x4
7942 / 7962 	320x196 	80x49 	/Desktops/320x196x4
7945 / 7965 	320x212 	80x53 	/Desktops/320x212x16
7970 / 7971 	320x212 	80x53 	/Desktops/320x212x12
7975            320x216 	80x53 	/Desktops/320x216x16
7985            800x600 	not supported 	/Desktops/800x600x16
8941 / 8945 	640x480 	123x111 	/Desktops/640x480x24

The Image file is used for the background of the phone display. An additional thumbnail is used as a preview image on the phone settings menu (on 7985 only the filename). The List.xml has to be in the above model-depending directory. The file has a Cisco IPPhoneImage syntax, example:

<CiscoIPPhoneImageList>
<ImageItem Image="TFTP:Desktops/640x480x24/sccp-tn.png"
           URL="TFTP:Desktops/640x480x24/sccp.png"/>
<ImageItem Image="TFTP:Desktops/640x480x24/sccp_2-tn.png"
           URL="TFTP:Desktops/640x480x24/sccp_2.png"/>
</CiscoIPPhoneImageList>

While the resolution is fix, the phones are able to reduce the color depth if the original image uses too many colors.
